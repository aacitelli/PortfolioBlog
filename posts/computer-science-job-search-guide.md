## Intro
Hey! I wasn't able to find a comprehensive and concise guide that took me through the entire process of searching for jobs as a Computer Science student, so I figured I'd write one up. 

Note that I hope to amend this article at a later date with more sources; I read about this stuff a lot and am just pulling from a few years of miscellaneous information pulled from all sorts of places. The tl;dr is that I don't have insider information or anything, but consider myself well-researched, and most of this information isn't personal opinion. 

I like to split up progress in hiring into the "stages" you go through:

1. Pre-Application
2. The Application
3. Coding Challenges
4. Technical Interviews & Whiteboarding
5. Behavioral Interviews
6. Offer!

## 1. Pre-Application
Before you even apply, you want to be doing some things that make things easier for you come hiring season. This mostly boils down to networking. I wish I'd done more. Having a good network can easily make up for other parts of your application that aren't great, or let you skip parts of it.  

1. **LinkedIn**: Make sure you keep this at least reasonably up to date, and cultivate your network where you can. Inbound opportunities (recruiters reaching out to *you*) are very valuable.
2. **Networking Events**: Oftentimes universities and university organizations host tons of networking events. Go, show your resume off, connect with everyone you meet on LinkedIn. It's often useful to approach this from a perspective of learning about the people, what they do, and what the industry is like, rather than explicitly being there for a job. Show interest in them; that will distinguish you. 

## 2. The Application
Most of this is your resume. A killer resume is **concise and straightforward, number-based, and gets through ATS**. You want to get through ATS, then have a resume that is quick and non-distracting for a hiring manager to read through. Focus on getting the maximum information conveyed per word. 

1. **Concise and Straightforward**: Do *not* use filler words. A line 75% of the way across the page that is packed with information is far better than a sparser line that goes the whole way across. Hiring managers value someone who can state concretely what they learned.
2. **Number-based**: If you are able to give quantitative statements (rather than qualitative, wishy-washy language), it looks amazing. 
3. **ATS Compatible**: If you highlight all the text on your resume and paste it into a text document, an ATS-optimized resume should be ordered correctly and not have any extra words.
    - Stuff like LaTeX can often mess this up pretty bad. For this reason, I recommend using a .docx resume and exporting that; it's what I personally do, and what's been recommended to me by a few people. 

**Cover Letters - Yes or No?**

Whether or not you do a cover letter is mostly just a function of how much you want the specific position. If you're just getting a bunch of applications out, I personally feel that time is better spent getting more applications out, but if you're focused on like 10-20 places, it's probably worth it.

Your cover letter should be short and sweet, ideally just a paragraph. Seriously - don't make this *any* longer than you have to to get your point across, as most hiring managers don't like opening a PDF and seeing three long paragraphs. You don't need filler or to recap anything that's on your resume. Use it to say anything relevant not on your resume or to say something you think will distinguish yourself from other candidates. 

## 3. Coding Challenges
The majority of the solution to getting good at these is to practice on sites like Leetcode and Hackerrank, no way around it. 

In terms of strategy, some pointers:
- Coding challenges are more focused on just getting a working solution that has good time complexity. Your goal during practice should align accordingly. Don't worry too much about commenting stuff out or writing super clean code, just worry about the end result. Get something working, then optimize it with what time you have left. 
- Use Leetcode/Hackerrank's mock interview feature to put yourself under the same time crunch. Don't skimp on it. 
- Most challenges will be something along the lines of a Leetcode Easy and a Medium. Completely dependent on the position and the company, though. 

## 4. Technical Interviews & Whiteboarding
The main advantage with technical interviews is that you can talk to your interviewer. 

Main strategy points:
- Focus more on being organized and communicating your process to your interviewer. They care more about how you come to your solution and that you genuinely know what you're talking about than whether you completed it. 
- A lot of companies will deliberately give you difficult problems, and you aren't expected to get the answer quickly. I believe the interviewers themselves are the ones that decide the problems, actually (source: CTCI?), but that likely depends on the company. 
- Communicate what you *do* know. If you're someone in university, you know a lot more theory than anyone in bootcamps or so on. Use that. 

## 5. Behavioral Interviews
Practice is also pretty important for these, but making sure you practice correctly is important. 

The general advice is to get all your experiences together and organized, then just find a ton of questions to mock interview yourself with and just drill them until it's more fluid for you. Your brain starts to internalize stuff, but it's not a short process. 

## 6. Offer!
Getting an offer is great, but it can often be worth it to try and negotiate, especially if you have more than one offer. I can't speak authoritatively on this, but [this blog post](https://www.kalzumeus.com/2012/01/23/salary-negotiation/) is generally considered the holy grail of SWE Negotation, so give it a read.

## FAQ
**How should my preparation changed based on if I'm going for Full-Time vs. an Internship?**

The only thing that really changes is how thoroughly you're interviewed. There's more focus on cultural fit and technical proficiency, so make sure you have behavioral problems down and are good at whiteboarding. 

Here's what the process generally looks like:
- **Internship**: Coding Challenge > Phone Screen (Behavioral) > Technical Interview > Offer
- **Full Time**: Coding Challenge > Phone Screen (Behavioral) > Several interviews, both behavioral and technical, generally all in one day > Offer
