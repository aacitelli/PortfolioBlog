## Overview
Earlier today, GameStop put the subdomain [https://nft.gamestop.com/](https://nft.gamestop.com/) up. I haven't seen an organized summary of everything going on from a perspective I'd like to see, and on what this likely means for the company, anywhere, so I figured I'd write up a recap of everything we know. 

## NFTs - A Recap
For those unfamiliar with NFTs, a brief overview: 

"Once it's on the internet, there's no getting it off" - Everyone's heard that at least once. The internet lends itself to replicating content on it very easily. It's easy enough for someone to download something to their computer, and once they do, it's a nightmare to get removed. For some good reading on this, look up the [Streisand Effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streisand_effect). 

NFTs are the reverse of that - a way to create scarcity and eliminate duplication on the internet. They are most frequently a way to track authenticity and ownership. They usually track some real-life item, with the general idea being this: If you are the owner of the NFT, you are the owner of the real-life item. It's a verifiable, public way to track ownership.

NFTs key characteristic are digitally signed and interlinked with blockchain technologies in a way that makes them unique ("non-fungible" is the namesake term) and incredibly difficult to fake (from a technical standpoint). Social engineering attacks (phishing, emails, getting people to download malware) are the only way I've read it being done, so similar to things like giving away the details of your cryptocurrency wallet, they are pretty secure. 

## GameStop 
So - onto the meat of the article. GameStop, NFTs, and what they could potentially mean for the company. We'll start with the website itself - you're welcome to look at it yourself at [nft.gamestop.com](nft.gamestop.com). 

Some things of note: 
- An Ethereum logo. For those unfamiliar, [Ethereum](https://ethereum.org/en/) is a prominent cryptocurrency and blockchain system that is very popular. 
- An email address for people to send CVs in. 
- An Ethereum address (starting in 1337420, which was intentional - see [this comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/nky0n0/gamestop_has_an_nft_website_setup/gzfur0k?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) for an explanation of the process) linking to a **GME Token** - the first one "minted". You can view the details of the transaction yourself here: https://etherscan.io/token/0x13374200c29c757fdcc72f15da98fb94f286d71e

To state the obvious, GameStop clearly intends to use NFTs and the blockchain in some manner. Here's a list of some commonly suggested possibilities, which I've summarized from a post by Reddit user [/u/teacoat___](reddit.com/u/teacoat___).
- GameStop tracks game ownership via NFTs, which enables a very powerful game reselling structure. This is essentially a higher-scale way to track licenses, but without many of the limitations, and could be a massive boost for GameStop when it comes to being a viable alternative to Steam. 
- GameStop pulls an [overstock-style crypto dividend](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/overstock-founder-tried-to-squeeze-short-sellers-then-sold-out-when-the-sec-cracked-down-2019-09-19), which if executed correctly would force all shorts to have to cover, no margin call needed. I'm not personally much of a market guy - go read through [/r/superstonk](reddit.com/r/superstonk) for more actual analysis. 
- GameStop showing they have a bunch of people on board that know what they're doing and can compete in new technologies with other technology giants.
- NFT-backed skin marketplace - essentially a higher-scale way to track rare items. Very conducive to pre-order and retailer-specific skins.
- NFT-backed console tracking, which can ensure new consoles, hardware, or software aren't [scalped](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/trading/05/scalping.asp)
- NFT-backed game launcher (or lack of needing a launcher in the first place). The idea is that you verify game ownership via an NFT and you don't need one universal application like Steam to tie them all together and handle game licenses and so on (at least, not so directly). 
- NFT-backed anti-piracy technology 
- NFT-backed cross-avatar/identity. A given NFT can act as your identity across platforms and synchronize everything. 

Other relevant information that's been unearthed: 
- Lots of people announcing themselves as new administration in GameStop's "NFTeam", which is essentially their blockchain department (adding further legitimacy that this will be a *very* big thing for GameStop). There seems to be some good talent in this group, including a [Matt Finestone](https://twitter.com/finestonematt/status/1397309790964047872?s=19), as the head of the operation. 
- The Ethereum transaction has some information associated with it, including a variable `launchDate` indicating a "release date" of Wed Jul 14 2021 11:20:00 GMT+0000, which is 7:20am EST and 4:20am PST. This is likely when the overall currency may go live - look for more details from GameStop over the next few weeks. 

I'm not expert, but it seems to me that GameStop is primed to upset a lot about the industry! We'll have to see what the coming weeks bring us. I will try to edit in any major information that comes up in the next few days and timestamp it - stay tuned!
